# Installing RTKLIB

We will use the free program [*RTKLIB*](http://www.rtklib.com/) to
correct dGPS points using kinematic post-processing (PPK) with a base
station. Download the file *rtklib\_2.4.2.zip* from the "Full Package
with Source Programs" area. The graphical user interface (GUI) is made
for **Windows (and we use Windows in this manual)**, on Linux or Mac the
command line interface (CUI) must be compiled by the user. 

**Note on Automation:** Everything we
do here can also be done at the command line (and therefore via programming in Python) on any operating system,
but here we only describe the processing of one file using the GUI on
Windows. The interested user is directed to the *RTKLIB* manual
(included in the folder *rtklib\_2.4.2 > docs*).

Unzip the *rtklib\_2.4.2.zip*, then go to *rtklib\_2.4.2 > bin* and
you will see the GUI programs including *rtkpost\_mkl.exe*, which we use
for this exercise. **We use the *\_mkl* version of *rtkpost*, which
allows fast multi-core processing**. The command line equivalent program
is *rtklib\_2.4.2 > bin > rnx2rtkp* (see the *RTKLIB* manual for
usage).

# Converting dGPS data to RINEX format

Different dGPS units record data in different formats. For example, a
Leica dGPS outputs files in *.m00* format. We need the data as *RINEX*
to proceed with open source correction. This is the standard / universal
GNSS format for data collection. You can read more about it here:
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RINEX>.

The easiest way to convert data is with the command line program [*teqc*](https://www.unavco.org/software/data-processing/teqc/teqc.html).
**Note: If you are using Trimble data in *.ssf* format, then you can
only convert to *RINEX* with the *Trimble Pathfinder Office* program.**
*Teqc* is included in *RTKLIB*. Open a command prompt window and input
the following (for a *.m00* dGPS file from a Leica unit):

```
cd C:\path\to\dGPS_files
```

```
C:\path\to\rtklib_2.4.2\bin\teqc.exe +obs FileName.obs +nav \
	FileName.nav FileName.m00
```

Here *FileName.m00* is the *.m00* file you want to convert, and
*FileName.obs/nav* are the same file converted to *RINEX* (with the same
root name, but different extensions). This will create a new two part
*RINEX* file: the *.obs* observation and *.nav* navigation. In the
example below we use a dGPS rover file collected on 26 February 2019
using a Leica model:

```
C:\path\to\rtklib_2.4.2\bin\teqc.exe +obs BP01_leicaR2.obs \
	+nav BP01_leicaR2.nav BP01_6611_0226_174951.m00
```

**Note on RINEX Formats:** Recently *RINEX* v.3 files have become
popular / standard. These files are capable of recording information
from additional satellite signals. Base station data downloaded for
correction will often be in this v.3 format. *Teqc* does not currently
support *RINEX* v.3 conversion, so the *.obs* and *.nav* *RINEX* files
output by *teqc* will be in v.2 format.

# Post-processing data with RTKLIB 

You can now use *RTKLIB* to post-process your *RINEX* files (*.obs* and
*.nav*) using PPK. Before we begin, we convert the date of the
collection (e.g., February 26, 2019) to the day of the year (e.g.,
*057*) with the calculator here:
<https://www-air.larc.nasa.gov/tools/jday.htm>. 

We also need the GPS
week and day of the week to download the orbital clock files (see Sect. [GNSS Satellite Orbital File](#gnss-satellite-orbital-file)), which we can look up here:
<https://www.ngs.noaa.gov/CORS/Gpscal.shtml>. For dGPS data collected on
26 February 2019, the week is 2042 and the day of the week is 2 (Sunday
= 0, Monday = 1 … Saturday = 6), giving a day identifier of *20422*.

All data that we require is hosted through the International GNSS
Service (IGS) and the links can be found at:
<https://kb.igs.org/hc/en-us/articles/115003935351>.

## Preparation

Before you can correct your data with *RTKLIB*, you will need to get (1)
the base-station data and (2) precise orbits. Some files from permanent
base stations may take one to two days to become available on the IGS
servers (<ftp://igs.ensg.ign.fr/pub/igs/>)

### Base Station

The local base station *RINEX* data can be downloaded from the following
FTP server for any permanent station around the world:
<ftp://igs.ensg.ign.fr/pub/igs/data/> The nearest permanent station can
be found here: <http://www.igs.org/network>. For example, GNSS data from
the Puna Plateau should be corrected with the Salta, Argentina permanent
station with code *UNSA*. Permanent station data for every day are at
<ftp://igs.ensg.ign.fr/pub/igs/data/*yyyy*/*doy*/*code\*.crx.gz*>
with *yyyy* year, *doy* day of year, *code* permanent station code
(*UNSA*), and \* is a wildcard containing additional file information.
We want the *crx.gz* file (not *rnx.gz* or *crx.sum.gz*), which is the
*compact-RINEX* (*CRINEX*) base station data, decimated to 30 second
observations. In the example,
*UNSA00ARG\_R\_20190570000\_01D\_30S\_MO.crx.gz* is used as the
permanent base station.

**NOTE:** You can also use your own base station *RINEX* data, in which
case you do NOT need to find or download the permanent station data, but
you still need to get the file into the *.YYo* *RINEX* observations
format as in the steps below.

#### Preparing the base station data 

Before we can use the *CRINEX* file
in *RTKLIB* we need to convert it to the standard, uncompressed *RINEX*
format (so from extension *.crx.gz* to extension *.YYo*) in the
following steps:

1. Unzip the *.gz* file to a *.crx* file (use the free program *7-zip* for this: <https://www.7-zip.org/download.html>

2. We also need to change the file extension to *.YYd* (where *YY* is the 2-digit year; 19 for 2019), this can be done at the command line with ```copy``` (on Windows) or ```cp``` (on Linux/Mac): 
```
copy FileName.crx FileName.YYd
```
For our file: 
```
copy UNSA00ARG_R_20190570000_01D_30S_MO.crx \
	UNSA00ARG_R_20190570000_01D_30S_MO.19d
```

3. Now we can use the command-line program *crx2rnx.exe* included in *RTKLIB* to convert from *CRINEX* to *RINEX*:
```
C:\path\to\rtklib_2.4.2\bin\crx2rnx.exe \
	FileName.YYd
```
For our file
```
C:\path\to\rtklib_2.4.2\bin\crx2rnx.exe \
	UNSA00ARG_R_20190570000_01D_30S_MO.19d
```
This will create our final *RINEX* base file automatically with the new extension *.YYo* (e.g., *UNSA00ARG\_R\_20190570000\_01D\_30S\_MO.19o*)

### Precise GNSS Orbits: Navigation and Orbital Files

We also need some GNSS satellite navigation files and the satellite
clock corrections to get a more exact dGPS correction. For additional
information on these files see here:
<ftp://www.ngs.noaa.gov/cors/README.txt>

#### GNSS Satellite Navigation File

The general navigation *RINEX* data (*brdc* file) can be downloaded from
the same server location as the base station:
<ftp://igs.ensg.ign.fr/pub/igs/data/*yyyy*/*doy*/*brdcdoy*0*.YYn.Z*>,
again replacing *yyyy*, *doy*, and *YY* with your numbers. We want the
*.YYn* file for GPS satellites and not the *.YYg*, which is for GLONASS
satellites. Again, unzip this *.Z* file using *7-zip*. We should now
have a navigation file like *brdc0570.19n*, where *057* is your
day-of-year and *19* is your 2-digit year identifier.

#### GNSS Satellite Orbital File

The precise orbits need to downloaded from a separate directory at the
same server: <ftp://igs.ensg.ign.fr/pub/igs/products/*wwww*/> where
*wwww* is the GPS week calculated above in Section [Post-processing data with RTKLIB](#post-processing-data-with-rtklib). There you will
find the orbital files for every day-of-week (Sunday = 0, Monday = 1 …
Saturday = 6) in the formats: *igp\*, igr\*,* or *igu\**. In this
example we use the ultra-rapid orbits: *igu20422\_18.sp3.Z*. Again,
unzip this *.Z* file using *7-zip*. We should now have an orbital file
like *igu20422\_18.sp3*, where *2042* is your GPS week, *2* is your
day-of-week, and in this case for the ultra-rapid orbits *\_18* is the
hour of release (either *\_00*, *\_06*, *\_12*, or *\_18*). The *igr\** and
*igp\** rapid and precise files do not have the hour-identifier and
would look like: *igr20422.sp3.Z*.

**NOTE**: The final precise orbits (*igp*\* files) are only available
12-18 days after the observation data. The rapid orbits (*igr*\* files)
are available 17-41 hours after the observation date and provide a
similar accuracy. For faster processing you can also use the ultra-rapid
orbits (*igu*\* files) produced every 6 hours.

## Files we now have for processing

* A *RINEX* *.obs* observation file from your field measurements (e.g., *BP01\_leicaR2.obs*)
* A *RINEX* *.YYo* observation file from your own base station OR a permanent station *RINEX* file (e.g., *UNSA00ARG\_R\_20190570000\_01D\_30S\_MO.19o*)
* A broadcast navigation file from you date (e.g., *brdc0570.19n*)
* An orbital file from your GPS week and day-of-week (e.g., *igu20422\_18.sp3* or *igr20422.sp3*)

## Processing Example

Open the *rtkpost\_mkl.exe* (not *rtkpost.exe*, that version is too
slow) program in the *rtklib\_2.4.2 > bin* directory. Follow
carefully the steps in Figure \ref{Fig:rtkpost_setup} to Figure \ref{Fig:rtkpost_view}, where we correct a file
collected on 26 February 2019 (*BP01\_leicaR2.obs*).

![*RTKPOST*
(*rtklib\_2.4.2 > bin > rtkpost\_mkl.exe* for post-processing dGPS
data. The first input is uncorrected *RINEX* observation data, the
second input is *RINEX* base station observation data, the third input
is satellite broadcast navigation data, and the fourth input is precise
orbit data. Output the corrected file as *.pos*. Now we need to set the
processing options in the following steps.\label{Fig:rtkpost_setup}](figs/rtkpost_setup.jpg)

![Tab 1 (Setting1) from the Options
list (Parameter Window (1/7)). Make use to use the Positioning Mode
Kinematic and also set all other parameters exactly as above. More
advanced users can look in the *RTKLIB* manual and change some of these
settings. Note that the calculation of the Kinematic solution will take
some time, but will yield very good results. One can use different
Ionospheric and Tropospheric correction and other options for the
correction of the satellite ephemeris and clocks.\label{Fig:rtkpost_options_1a}](figs/rtkpost_options_1a.jpg)

Geoid Models (e.g., EGM96) can be selected.\label{Fig:rtkpost_options_3}](figs/rtkpost_options_3.jpg)

# Resulting Data

The *.pos* file output by *RTKLIB* (Fig. \ref{Fig:rtkpost_view}) can be opened in any
text-editor. For details of the column names, refer to the *RTKLIB*
manual. The most important columns for us are the latitude, longitude,
height, and the uncertainty in x, y, and z directions (sdn, sde, and
sdu; provided in meters). Be careful to only use points with low (&lt;
0.5 m or even less) vertical uncertainty in further analysis. The file
can be converted to a *.csv* file and imported into QGIS then saved as a
shapefile. Alternatively, the *.pos* file can be read in directly to
Python or MATLAB and manipulated from there (e.g., as a Python pandas
dataframe).

## Converting Data to .csv and .shp

The first step is to open the *.pos* file in a text editor ([notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.6.3.html) is
a pretty good one).
Delete all lines that begin with "%" and add as a new first line (Figure \ref{Fig:convert_pos_to_csv_1}-\ref{Fig:convert_pos_to_csv_2}):

*GPST,latitude(deg),longitude(deg),height(m),Q,ns,sdn(m),sde(m),sdu(m),sdne(m),sdeu(m),sdun(m),age(s),ratio*

Next save the file with a new extension *.csv* (for comma separated
values). This *.csv* can now be opened in QGIS by clicking the "Add
Delimited Text Layer" option (Figure \ref{Fig:convert_csv_to_shp_1}). The file can be opened and
saved out as a shapefile as shown in Figure \ref{Fig:convert_csv_to_shp_2}-\ref{Fig:convert_csv_to_shp_4}.

![Open the *.pos* file in your favorite
text editor. Here I’m using Notepad++.\label{Fig:convert_pos_to_csv_1}](figs/convert_pos_to_csv_1.jpg)

![Delete all the lines beginning with %
from the *.pos* file. Add a new first line:
*GPST,latitude(deg),longitude(deg),height(m),Q,ns,sdn(m),sde(m),sdu(m),sdne(m),sdeu(m),sdun(m),age(s),ratio*.
Save the file as a *.csv*.\label{Fig:convert_pos_to_csv_2}](figs/convert_pos_to_csv_2.jpg)

![Open QGIS and add the *.csv* file
with "Create Layer from Delimited Text File Option".\label{Fig:convert_csv_to_shp_1}](figs/convert_csv_to_shp_1.jpg)

![Browse to the new *.csv* file in
"File Name". The information should be automatically filled out by the
tool and should look like the above (longitude as the X field and
latitude as the Y field).\label{Fig:convert_csv_to_shp_2}](figs/convert_csv_to_shp_2.jpg)

![When prompted, give the coordinate
system of the file as WGS84.\label{Fig:convert_csv_to_shp_3}](figs/convert_csv_to_shp_3.jpg)

![Right click on the file and go to
"Save As". Save the file out as "ESRI Shapefile" format, and provide a
file name with the extension *.shp*. Press "OK" and the data is now
converted to a *.shp* file for further use. It may be good to delete
points from this shapefile with uncertainties in *XYZ* (*sdn, sde, sdu*)
> 0.5 m, or even more precise (> 0.1 m), depending on your application and desired precision.\label{Fig:convert_csv_to_shp_4}](figs/convert_csv_to_shp_4.jpg)
